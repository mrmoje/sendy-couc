# sendy-couc
A solution for a sample combo-geo-polyline detour problem (from Sendy's Combined Orders Use Case challange)

### The problem/challenge:-
Given two geo-polylines AD and BC, come up with an algorithm to determine
the "detour" associated with their combined geo-polyline and further determine
if the detour is negligable enough for one to traverse the combined geo-polyline.
